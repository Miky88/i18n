HELP:
  TITLE: Giveaways
  DESCRIPTION: |-
    To start a giveaway, simply run `{{prefix}} giveaway <time> <prize>`.

    To cancel a giveaway, run `{{prefix}} giveaway --{{cancel}} <ID>`
    To close a giveaway (ie. immediately roll a winner), run `{{prefix}} giveaway --{{close}} <ID>`
    To reroll a giveaway, run `{{prefix}} giveaway --{{reroll}} <ID>`

    Altough `{{close}}` and `{{reroll}}` both do essentially the same thing, they aren't interchangeable. If the giveaway you're rerolling is still open, `{{reroll}}` will work exactly as `{{close}}`, but the same can't be said about the opposite; if the target giveaway is closed, `{{close}}` will simply ignore your command, while `{{reroll}}`Â will successfully reroll the winner.

    `<ID>` is the Message ID of the Giveaway message. You can discover how to get IDs by following this guide: {{docs}}/guides/getting-ids

# lowercase
REROLL: reroll

NO_WINNER: Nobody reacted to the giveaway, so nobody was chosen.
NO_GIVEAWAY_ID: There's no giveaway with that ID.
