HELP:
  TITLE: "`warn` command."
  DESCRIPTION: "Create warns and manage infractions for users.
    

    You can warn a user with `{{prefix}} warn @User [reason]` (the reason is optional).
    If you don't want the user to be alerted of this, you can use the `--no-dm-user` flag (shadow-warn).
    The bot will then show you the ID for the infraction.
    
    
    You can always see all the infractions with `{{prefix}} warn @User --{{list}}`.
    
    
    If you messed up, you can edit a reason with `{{prefix}} warn @User --{{edit}} <id>`.
    The bot will then ask you the new reason. You can use `{{old}}` to reference the current reason (if maybe you're adding stuff to that).
    
    
    To delete an infraction, use `{{prefix}} warn @User --{{remove}} <id>`.
    If you, instead, want to delete all the infractions of a user, you may do so with `{{prefix}} warn @User --{{clear}}`."

OK:
  WARN:
    DM: "{{user}} has been warned. Infraction ID: `{{id}}`"
    NO_DM: "{{user}} has been warned, but I was unable to send the Direct Message. Infraction ID: `{{id}}`"
  EDIT: "The infraction has been edited."
  REMOVE: "The infraction has been removed."
  CLEAR: "{{user}}'s infractions have been cleared."

ERRORS:
  NO_ID: An infraction with ID `{{id}}` doesn't exist.
  NO_WARNS: "{{user}} has no infractions."
  NO_STAFF: You can't warn someone with a permission level equal or higher than yours!
